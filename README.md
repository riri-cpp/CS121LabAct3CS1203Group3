## System Description
This is an interactive console application designed to simulate the operation of various types of vehicles, including cars, buses, yachts, and trucks. The program utilizes object-oriented programming principles, specifically inheritance and abstraction, to create a flexible and extensible system for managing different vehicle types.

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your device.
2. Copy the entire code of the Vehicle Management Program provided above into a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.
3. Save the file with a '.py' extension, for example, 'garage.py'.
4. Execute the program on the text editor or IDE.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts
   
   * Once the program starts, you will see a welcome message and a prompt to select a vehicle type.
   * Enter the corresponding number for the vehicle you wish to operate (1 for Car, 2 for Bus, 3 for Yacht, 4 for Truck) and press Enter.
   * Follow the subsequent prompts to enter the maximum number of passengers, fuel type, and whether you want to drive the vehicle. The program will guide you through the process.
   
6. After entering the required information, you can start the vehicle, fill it with fuel, and choose to drive it at a specified speed. The program will provide feedback based on your actions.
7. Once you are done interacting with the vehicle, the program will display a closing message. You can then close the terminal or command prompt window.
